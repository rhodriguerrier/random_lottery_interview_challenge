# Random Lottery Number Generator - Interview Challenge

A simple python tkinter gui that allows the user to generate random lottery numbers.

There is a dropdown so the user can choose between the standard six or one extra for seven.

Each number is unique compared to those in its set and presented in ascending order.

Lastly, each number is coloured according to the below mapping:
- Grey = 1 - 9
- Blue = 10 - 19
- Pink = 20 - 29
- Green = 30 - 39
- Yellow = 40 - 49
